# Unity-Scene-Exporter
Way to export scenes that have references to scripts in a dll and therefore breaking them when importing in a project that directly has thos scripts. This will make it able to import them from a different project using the fileID and guid in the .unity file. THIS IS VERY MUCH A WIP AND FAR FROM DONE.
